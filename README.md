# kelenedy-front-end

The Kelenedy app utilizes a makeup API to create an online store such that a user can create a account, browse products by category and/or brand, create a favorite products list, and generate a shopping cart for their purchase.

Kelenedy uses Ruby '2.3.3' and the Makeup API found at http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/

The backend for Kelenedy can be found at https://github.com/marylenec/kelenedy-back-end
